AllData
=======

To install AllData you need to create a MySQL database and insert the database structure from the app/alldata_database_structure.sql file. Then you have to setup the database connection by changing the file app/Config/database_must_be_setup.php to database.php and setting the database, host, user and password. Then you are ready to use it!
