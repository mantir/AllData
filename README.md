AllData
=======

To install AllData you need to create a MySQL database and insert the database structure from the **app/alldata_database_structure.sql** file. 

Then you have to setup the database connection by renaming **app/Config/database_must_be_setup.php** to **database.php** and setting the database name, host, username and password in this file. Then you are ready to go!
